# Spotify Track Downloader

This is a Python script that allows you to download tracks from Spotify.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   A Spotify developer account and a project in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-track-downloader.git` 

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

`cd spotify-track-downloader` 

3.  Install the required libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

4.  Replace the `client_id` and `client_secret` variables with your own client ID and client secret, obtained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

## Usage

To download a track, set the `track_id` variable to the ID of the track you want to download, and then run the script:

`python downloader.py` 

The track will be downloaded as an MP3 file to the current directory.

## Notes

-   The Spotify Web API has rate limits, so you may need to throttle your requests if you are downloading a large number of tracks.
-   Some tracks may not have a streaming URL available, in which case the download will fail.
